# HarmonyHouse Furniture

## Project Name & Pitch

HarmonyHouse Furniture is an e-commerce application designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience for high-quality furniture products. Built with React, Vite, and other modern technologies, this project aims to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly platform for purchasing furniture items.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users will be able to browse through a catalog of furniture products, view detailed product information, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Additional features such as user authentication and advanced search functionalities are planned for future development.


## Installation and Setup Instructions

To get started with HarmonyHouse Furniture, follow these steps:

1. Clone down this repository.
2. Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed globally on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to install dependencies:
   npm install
5. To start the development server, run:
npm start
6. Once the server is running, you can visit the app at:
http://localhost:5173/



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the development server using Vite.

### `npm start`

Alias for `npm run dev`.

### `npm run build`

Builds the project for production using TypeScript and Vite.

### `npm run dev:build`

Builds the project in development mode using TypeScript and Vite.

### `npm run format`

Formats code files in the `src` directory using Prettier.

### `npm run ci:format`

Checks code formatting in the `src` directory using Prettier and reports any deviations from the formatting rules.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint to analyze code in the `src` directory, specifically files with extensions `.ts` and `.tsx`. It enforces coding standards and reports any potential errors or warnings.

### `npm run preview`

Previews the production build using Vite.

### `npm test`

Runs tests using Vitest.

### `npm run prepare`

This script is executed automatically by npm before the package is packed and published. In this case, it sets up Husky, a tool for creating Git hooks.


## Reflection

### Context
This project was initiated as part of a personal endeavor to create a fully functional e-commerce platform for furniture products. It serves as a learning experience to gain proficiency in React development and modern frontend tooling.

### Goals
The main goal of this project was to build a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing furniture items online. Emphasis was placed on creating an intuitive shopping experience and implementing responsive design principles.

### Challenges
One of the main challenges encountered during development was integrating the backend API with the frontend application to fetch product data dynamically. Additionally, optimizing the performance of the application, especially in handling large amounts of product data, posed a significant challenge.

### Tools and Technologies
The project leverages React.js for building the user interface, Vite for fast and efficient development, and other libraries and tools to enhance functionality and maintainability. The choice of React and Vite was motivated by their popularity in the frontend development community and their ability to streamline the development process.

### Future Improvements
In future iterations of the project, efforts will be directed towards implementing additional features such as user authentication, advanced search capabilities, and integration with payment gateways for secure transactions. Continuous optimization and refinement of the user interface will also be prioritized to enhance the overall user experience.
